title: How to work with monkeys üêí and gorillas ü¶ç
---

The article Management Time: Who's Got the Monkey? brought me a clearer vision of delegation strategy and empowerment of my team.
This article presents the idea that all the tasks/problems that we have to deal with are monkeys that we carry on our backs.
Gorillas are the prominent tasks! ü¶ç 
We need to make sure that we feed and take care of our monkeys or delegate it to other people, or we can't take care of our gorillas because we are surrounded by monkeys all over the place!!
When we delegate a monkey, we cannot assume that the other person knows how to take care of the monkey. We need to teach and do frequent checky ins to validate if the animal is evaluated properly. 
The monkey can come back for you. The goal is to avoid it by providing enough tools and help so your people can do it by themself.
