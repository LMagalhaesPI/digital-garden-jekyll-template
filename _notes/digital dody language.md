### Why is it importante?

Please don't fucking do multitasking while I'm fucking speaking and spending my fucking time and fucking energy with you!!!!!!!!!!!!

All of us valuate our work and like to be valued because of it! True!!! No if we feel that we are spending our time, ebergy, money with someone that doesn give a shit to our work can creta frustartion and atrict in the team. 

### Actions that can be identified as "I don't give a shit to your work"
- Multitasking in meetings or discussions: if you are in a meeting, please pay attention and respect all the rest of the people in that meeting! Unless you are facing an urgent issue!
 - What is an urgent issue: someone is dying, service is production is down or we have a possible investment depending on something. Is someone dying? No!! So. it is not urgent!
 - Meeting with the webCam off. If everyone in the team has the web Cam on, please do the same unless you have a really bad haircut! And even then, you can wear a hat!!
 - Don't pay attention to the rest of the teamwork. If you are in a meeting where you are discussing subject A, and you are not paying attention, asking questions about subject A you are just not respecting your team's work. 
 - Focus on our individual work ignoring the rest of the people's work. All of us have different priorities. For a developer can be to have a new task to work on, for a QA to have the environment working properly and for the team leads to just deliver the task to prod. If we don't work together and just focus on our individual work, we cannot deliver value because we are not focused on the final result but on our little piece of work! It is important to respect and read the "room" so we can help the team as an all to deliver. 


## The message that we pass

I'm a woman, and usually, I feel lucky because I didn't have occasions where I could feel discriminated against due to my gender. But it happens, and happens even when the source can notice it: 

When I'm criticized for a commonly accepted behavior, when is a man performing it: as a lead in my professional life, I had to face more than once people tagging me as too rigid when asking my team co-workers to perform some actions. After some observations and reading this book, I noticed that the same kind of instruction coming for men is well received and with enthusiasm. Why can it happen? Because I'm a woman, I'm identified with rigid when I'm just communicating directions or actions that have to be performed? It would be great to assume the same respect and behavior for men and women, of course with the fisical differences but expecting the same level of professionalism and results.
