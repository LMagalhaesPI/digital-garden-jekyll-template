My top insights and actions after reading the book Digital Body Language

Working completely remote is fantastic. I love it! I have more freedom to travel and be with my family and friends, but... we know that communication can get even worse that working in the office. Sometimes it is already a huge challenge when we are working 2 meters away, so 2000 km seems impossible. It is not, but it was a concern for me, and in my attempt to improve my communication skills I have been reading the book "Digital Body language" by the digital body language expert Erica Dhawan.

## Why is it important?
What is more important? What do we say, or how do we say it? Studies show that the unspoken part of our communication, our body language, is responsible for more than 90 percent of our message. 

More and more, we work in a virtual world where we don't have to shake hands or maintain good eye contact, but we still have nonverbal communication. Body language didn't disappear; in the digital world, we react to emojis, punctuation, our choice of communication media, and our video meetings, among other things that can transmit a message.  

And working with more human beings, our message and the way we interact is still essential, whether in a digital world. We want to create relationships based on trust, inclusion, and transparency and create a good culture and work environment where we can deliver the most possible value. That is why we need to pay attention to our digital body language and our digital image.

## Digital anxiety, yes, I'm zen, and I'm fighting it!!

We have challenging jobs, we are under pressure most of our days, and the way we communicate is a significant source of it. Some examples of actions that create digital anxiety and how I now deal with it:

 - Ghosting, slower or no responses - We are all busy, we have demanding agendas and our own priorities, and that is ok! I have been in the extreme where I felt that I should answer right way to all the messages! Impossible! 
I had to deal with co-workers expecting a message right away! When questioned in the absence of an answer, the person was doing the same question to a different person who didn't answer right away because they were doing their own things, so this specific nice person asked a third person!!! In the end, a simple and not urgent question spent time and energy from three different people. 

How I deal with it now:

  - Defining boundaries and workplace expectations- I had a meeting with my team where we defined our tools and ways of communication. My team now knows how to ping me if they have an urgent matter to discuss and that they need to wait if it is not critical. 
  - Answer with just a check: '1 min'. It works for my team like: 'I've read your message, I will answer as soon as I can!! I'm not ignoring you! And I like to work with you ❤️'. Of course, it is with me and probably not the clearest message to everyone!
  
- Leaders should be a road model - respect the rest and concentration time and make you be respected too! Booked the concentration-time and effectively used it to concentrate on your job! If we don't are constantly reacting instead of planning and acting, our work is just a result of external situations, and as engineers, we cannot produce the proper technologies  
- Brevity - With short cuts we  can make mistakes, confusion. Be brief and precise, and if you don't understand ask for clarifications
 - Aggressiveness - Passive-aggressive - DOn't take anything personally, and don't assume an interpretation. Just clarify it before assuming conclusions

## Four lows of digital body language and how I integrated it...

### Value visibility
  This low can be translated into valuing people's time and energy. For me, it should be common sense, but the truth is that we are not all the time aware of how we communicate and how our behavior can be interpreted. Some rules that can help with it:
  - Being attentive and aware of others, value their feelings, even the ones that can cause discomfort, and pay attention to them.
  - Accept different opinions. A solution that worked in a context can not work in a different one and don't assume that you own the right answer.  
  - Not cancel meetings at the last minute or don't reschedule it every 5 minutes. 
  - Associate a clear agenda to every meeting and do a brief resume of it. 
  - Don't assume that everything is right because people are quiet. A problem doesn't disappear just because you don't see it. 
  - Practice active listening. We all value our work and like to be valued because of it! True!!! No, if we feel that we are spending our time, energy, and money with someone that is more focused on other things than our work at the time can create frustration and atrict in the team. 

### Communicate carefully
   Don't assume that others understand your message; there are some small rules that we can apply to make sure that our message is passed:
   - Review all the emails and essential messages before you send it;
   - Create metrics of success and ways to work, define and write it down after discussing with the team. 
   - Create a transparency culture where teams and collaborators and informed and up to date. 

### Collaborate confidently 
  Working in a remote environment could be more difficult, but it is really important to include everyone in the team's discussions and decisions, no matter how far they are. People need to have ownership over the work we deliver and feel that their time is valuable. To respect this low, the most important rules are:
  - Create an environment of freedom to speak and empowerment to respond with care and patience instead of pressing them to respond to everything immediately in a 24/7 workplace.
  - Provide opportunities to everyone express thyself and group thinking;
  - Making sure that everyone has everything they need to move on and prioritization well defined;
  -  

### Trust totally 
It can be the most challenging low to implement because to create a trust totally culture; you have to expose your vulnerabilities, show that it is not a problem when you are wrong, and everyone is wrong sometimes. But all of us have an ego!! As a lead is really important don-t let our egos create an oppressive environment. Everyone should feel safe speaking up, introducing a controversial perspective, asking for help, or simply saying, "this is not working for me".

### Actions that can be identified as "I don't give a shit to your work"
- Multitasking in meetings or discussions: if you are in a meeting, please pay attention and respect all the rest of the people in that meeting! Unless you are facing an urgent issue!
 - What is an urgent issue: someone is dying, service is production is down or we have a possible investment depending on something. Is someone dying? No!! So. it is not urgent!
 - Meeting with the webCam off. If everyone in the team has the web Cam on, please do the same unless you have a really bad haircut! And even then, you can wear a hat!!
 - Don't pay attention to the rest of the teamwork. If you are in a meeting where you are discussing subject A, and you are not paying attention, asking questions about subject A you are just not respecting your team's work. 
 - Focus on our individual work ignoring the rest of the people's work. All of us have different priorities. For a developer can be to have a new task to work on, for a QA to have the environment working properly and for the team leads to just deliver the task to prod. If we don't work together and just focus on our individual work, we cannot deliver value because we are not focused on the final result but on our little piece of work! It is important to respect and read the "room" so we can help the team as an all to deliver. 


## The message that we pass

I'm a woman, and usually, I feel lucky because I didn't have too many occasions where I could feel discriminated against due to my gender. But it happens, and happens even when the source can't notice it: 

When I'm criticized for a commonly accepted behavior when is a man is performing it. As a leader in my professional life, I had to face more than once people tagging me as too rigid when asking my team co-workers to perform some actions. After some observations and reading this book, I noticed that the same kind of instruction coming for men is well received and enthusiastic. Why can it happen? Because I'm a woman, I'm identified as rigid when I'm just communicating directions or actions that have to be performed? It would be great to assume the same respect and behavior for men and women, despite the physical differences but expecting the same level of professionalism and results.
