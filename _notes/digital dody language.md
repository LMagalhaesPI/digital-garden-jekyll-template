Working completely remote is fantastic. I love it! I have more freedom to travel and be with my family and friends, but‚Ä¶ we know that communication can get even worse than working in the office.

Sometimes it can be a huge challenge when working 2 meters away, so two thousand kilometers seems impossible! It is not, but it was a concern for me. In my attempt to improve my communication skills, I read the book "Digital Body language" by the digital body language expert Erica Dhawan.

I have written down in the article my top insights and actions after reading the book and applying some of the learnings.

## Why is it important?
What is more important, what we say or how we say it? Studies show that the unspoken part of our communication, our body language, is responsible for more than 90 percent of our message.

More and more, we work in a virtual world where we don't have to shake hands or maintain good eye contact, but we still have nonverbal communication. Body language didn't disappear; in the digital world, we react to emojis, punctuation, our choice of communication media, and our video meetings, among other things that can transmit a message.

And working with human beings, our message and how we interact is still essential, even in the digital world. We want to create relationships based on trust, inclusion, transparency and create a good culture and work environment where we can deliver the possible value. That is why we need to pay attention to our digital body language and our digital image.

## Digital anxiety! Yes! I‚Äôm zen, and I‚Äôm fighting it!! üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

We have challenging jobs, we are under pressure most of our days, and the way we communicate is a significant source of it. Some examples of actions that create digital anxiety and how I now deal with it:

Ghosting, slower or no responses ‚Äî We are all busy, we have demanding agendas and our priorities, and that is ok! In my past I have adopted the extreme reaction where I felt that I should answer the right way to all the messages! Impossible!I had to deal with co-workers expecting a message right away! When questioned in the absence of an answer, the person was doing the same question to a different person who didn't answer right away because they were doing their own things, so this specific nice person asked a third person!!! In the end, a simple and not urgent question spent time and energy from three different people.How I deal with it now:<br/>
‚úîÔ∏è Defining boundaries and workplace expectations- I had a meeting with my team where we defined our tools and ways of communication. My team now knows how to ping me if they have an urgent matter to discuss and that they need to wait if it is not critical. <br/>
‚úîÔ∏è Answer with just a check: '1 min'. It works for my team like: 'I've read your message, I will answer as soon as I can!! I'm not ignoring you! And I like to work with you ‚ù§Ô∏è'. Of course, it is not the clearest message to everyone, but it works in my team because it was discussed and defined in the team!<br/>
‚úîÔ∏è Leaders should be a road model ‚Äî respect your and your team members' rest and concentration time! Book the concentration time and effectively use it to concentrate on your work! As engineers, we need time to act and plan instead of reacting to external situations. And we need time to have it.
‚úîÔ∏è Brevity ‚Äî With shortcuts, we can create mistakes and confusion. Be brief and precise, and ask for clarifications if you don't understand.<br/>
‚úîÔ∏è Aggressiveness ‚Äî When dealing with passive-aggressive people, don't take anything personally and don't assume anything. Just clarify it before jumping to conclusions.<br/>

## Four lows of digital body language and how I integrated it‚Ä¶

### Value visibility

Being attentive and aware of others, value their feelings, even the ones that can cause discomfort, and pay attention to them.

This low can be translated into valuing people's time and energy. For me, it should be common sense, but the truth is that we are not all the time aware of how we communicate and how our behavior can be interpreted. Some rules that can help with it:

- Don't cancel meetings at the last minute or don't reschedule them every 5 minutes.
- Associate a clear agenda to every meeting and briefly summarize it.
- Don't assume that everything is right because people are quiet. A problem doesn't disappear just because you don't see it.
- Practice active listening. We all value our work and like to be valued because of it! True!!! No, if we feel that we are spending our time, energy, and money with someone more focused on other things than our work at the time can create frustration and friction in the team.

### Communicate carefully

Don‚Äôt assume that others understand your message; there are some small rules that we can apply to make sure that our message is passed:

- Review all the emails and essential messages before you send it;
- Don't assume that others understand your message; there are some small rules that we can apply to make sure that our message is passed:

- Review all the emails and essential messages before you send it;
- Create success metrics and ways to work, define and write it down after discussing with the team.
- Create a transparent culture where teams and collaborators are informed and up to date.

### Collaborate confidently

Working in a remote environment could be more difficult, but it is really important to include everyone in the team‚Äôs discussions and decisions, no matter how far they are. People need to have ownership over the work we deliver and feel that their time is valuable. The most important rule to respect this low is to create an environment of freedom to speak and empowerment to respond with care and patience instead of pressing them to respond to everything immediately in a 24/7 workplace.

Working in a remote environment can be more difficult, but it is really important to include everyone in the team's discussions and decisions, no matter how far they are. People need to have ownership over the work we deliver and feel that their time is valuable. To respect this low, the most important rules are:

- Create an environment of freedom to speak and empowerment to respond with care and patience instead of pressing them to respond to everything immediately in a 24/7 workplace;
- Provide opportunities for everyone to express themselves and to create group thinking;
- Making sure that everyone has everything they need to move on and prioritization well defined;

### Trust totally

It can be the most challenging low to implement because to create a trust totally culture; you have to expose your vulnerabilities, show that it is not a problem when you are wrong, and everyone is wrong sometimes. But all of us have an ego!! As a lead is really important not to let our egos create an oppressive environment. Everyone should feel safe speaking up, introducing a controversial perspective, asking for help, or simply saying, "this is not working for me".

## Actions that can be identified as "I don't care about your work."

- Multitasking in meetings or discussions: if you are in a meeting, please pay attention and respect all the rest of the people in that meeting! Unless you are facing an urgent issue!
- What is an urgent issue: someone is dying, service in production is down, or we have a possible investment depending on something. Is someone dying? No!! So, it is not urgent!
- Meeting with the webCam off. If everyone in the team has the web Cam on, please do the same unless you have a terrible haircut! And even then, you can wear a hat!!
- Don't pay attention to the rest of the teamwork. If you are in a meeting where you are discussing subject A, not paying attention, or asking questions about subject B, you are just not respecting your team's work.
- Focus on our individual work ignoring the team's work and the expected result. All of us have different priorities. A developer can be to have a new task to dive into an exciting code challenge, for a QA to have the environment working properly and for the team leads just to deliver the feature to prod. If we don't work together and just focus on our individual work, we cannot provide value because we are not focused on the final result but on our little piece of work! It is essential to respect and read the "room" so we can help the team as an all to deliver.

## Conclusions

The most significant insight that I can take from this book is that we are not aware of our impact and how others translate our actions?. Communicating with human beings is not so easy. It seems that we have feelings, and our brains work differently, so we need to pay attention to them and make sure that our message is passed. At the same time, we need to remember that we are all humans, and we should be empathetic. We don't know what's going on in other people's lives; maybe the person complaining about our work is just having a horrible day with a toothache. For me is about having an awareness of our actions and feelings and remembering that we should not judge before asking!!In conclusion, everyone that needs to use digital communication channels should read this book.

I would like to thank Erica Dhawan fr writing this book that fantastic book and my team for being open and always motivated to do our best.
