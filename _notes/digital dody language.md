Working remotely is fantastic. I love it! I have more freedom to travel and be with my family and friends, but we know that communication can be worse than working in the office.

Sometimes it can be a huge challenge when working just 2 meters away, so two thousand kilometers seems impossible, right? Wrong, it is not, but it was a concern for me. In my attempt to improve my remote communication skills, I read the book ‚ÄúDigital Body language‚Äù, by the digital body language expert Erica Dhawan.

In this article, I have summarized my top insights and actions after reading this book, and applying some learnings.

## Why is it important?
What is more important; What we say or how we say it? Studies show that the unspoken part of our communication, our body language, is responsible for more than 90 percent of our message.

We are currently working more and more in the virtual world where we don‚Äôt have to shake hands or maintain good eye contact, but we still have nonverbal communication. Body language didn‚Äôt disappear; in the virtual world for example, we react to emojis, punctuation, our choice of communication media, and our video meetings, among other things that transmit a message.

When working with human beings, our message and how we interact is still essential, even in the digital world. We want to create relationships based on trust, inclusion, transparency and create a good culture and work environment where we can deliver the best possible value. That is why we need to pay attention to our digital body language and our digital image.

## Digital anxiety! Yes! I‚Äôm zen, and I‚Äôm fighting it!! üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

We have challenging jobs. We are under pressure most days and the way we communicate is a significant source of it. Some examples of actions that create digital anxiety and how I now deal with it:

- Ghosting, slower or no responses: We are all busy, we have demanding agendas and priorities, and that is ok! In the past I had adopted the extreme reaction of feeling that I should answer all message the right way. Impossible!

I had to deal with co-workers expecting a response right away! In the absence of an answer, the person would ask the same question to a different person, who also didn‚Äôt answer right away because they were busy with their own things, so this specific nice person asked a third person!!! In the end, a simple and not urgent question took the time and energy from three different people.

How I deal with it now:<br/>
‚úîÔ∏è **Defining boundaries and workplace expectations:** I had a meeting with my team where we defined our tools and ways of communication. My team now knows how to ping me if they have an urgent matter to discuss and that they need to wait if it is not critical. <br/>
‚úîÔ∏è **Answer with just a check:** ‚Äò1 min‚Äô. It works for my team like: ‚ÄòI‚Äôve read your message, I will answer as soon as I can!! I‚Äôm not ignoring you! And I like to work with you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äô. Of course, it is not the clearest message for everyone, but it works in my team because it was discussed and defined in the team!<br/>
‚úîÔ∏è **Leaders should be a role model:** respect your, and your team members‚Äô rest and concentration time! Book the concentration time and effectively use it to concentrate on your work! As engineers, we need time to act and plan instead of reacting to external situations. And we need time to have it.
‚úîÔ∏è **Brevity:** With shortcuts, we can make mistakes and create confusion. Be brief and precise, and ask for clarifications if you don‚Äôt understand.<br/>
‚úîÔ∏è **Aggressiveness:** When dealing with passive-aggressive people, don‚Äôt take anything personally and don‚Äôt assume anything. Just clarify it before jumping to conclusions.<br/>

## Four lows of digital body language and how I integrated it‚Ä¶

### Value visibility

This law can be translated into valuing people‚Äôs time and energy. For me, it should be common sense, but the truth is that we are not always aware of how we communicate and how our behavior can be interpreted. Some rules that can help with this:

- Accept different opinions. A solution that worked in one context might not work in a different one, and don‚Äôt assume that you know the correct answer;
- Don‚Äôt cancel meetings at the last minute or don‚Äôt reschedule them every 5 minutes;
- Associate a clear agenda for every meeting and briefly summarize it;
- Don‚Äôt assume that everything is right because people are quiet. A problem doesn‚Äôt disappear just because you don‚Äôt see it;
- Practice active listening. We all value our work and like to be valued because of it! True!!! No, if we feel that we are spending our time, energy, and money with someone more focused on other things than our work, at the time, can create frustration and friction in the team;

### Communicate carefully

Don‚Äôt assume that others understand your message; there are some small rules that we can apply to make sure that our message is passed on accurately:

- Review all the emails and essential messages before you send them;
- Create success metrics and ways to work. Define and write them down after discussing with the team;
- Create a transparent culture where teams and collaborators are informed and up to date;

### Collaborate confidently

Working in a remote environment could be more difficult, but it is really important to include everyone in the team‚Äôs discussions and decisions, no matter how far they are. People need to have ownership over the work we deliver and feel that their time is valued. The most important rule to define this law is; create an environment of freedom of speech and empowerment to respond with care and patience instead of pressing them to respond to everything immediately in a 24/7 workplace.

Working in a remote environment can be more difficult, but it is really important to include everyone in the team‚Äôs discussions and decisions, no matter how far they are. People need to have ownership over the work we deliver and feel that their time is valuable. To respect this Law, the most important rules are:

- Provide opportunities for everyone to express themselves and to create group thinking;
- Making sure that everyone has everything they need to move on and prioritization is well defined;

### Trust totally

It can be the most challenging law to implement because to create a ‚ÄòTrust totally‚Äô culture; you have to expose your vulnerabilities, show that it is not a problem when you are wrong, because everyone is wrong sometimes. But all of us have an ego!! As a lead, it is really important not to let our egos create an oppressive environment. Everyone should feel safe speaking up, introducing a controversial perspective, asking for help, or simply saying, ‚Äúthis is not working for me‚Äù.

## Actions that can be identified as "I don't care about your work."

- Multitasking in meetings or discussions: if you are in a meeting, please pay attention and respect the rest of the people in that meeting! Unless you are facing an urgent issue!
- What is an urgent issue: someone is dying, service in production is down, or we have a possible investment depending on something. Is someone dying? No!! So, it is not urgent!
- Meeting with the webCam off. If everyone in the team has the web Cam on, please do the same unless you have a terrible haircut! And even then, you can wear a hat!!
- Not paying attention to the rest of the team‚Äôs work. If you are in a meeting where you are discussing subject A, not paying attention, or asking questions about subject B, you are just not respecting your team‚Äôs work.
- Focusing on our individual work while ignoring the team‚Äôs work and the expected result. All of us have different priorities. A developer could have a new task of diving into an exciting code challenge, and a QA could have the environment working properly for the team leads just to deliver the feature to prod. If we don‚Äôt work together and just focus on our individual work, we cannot provide value because we are not focused on the final result, but only on our little piece of work! It is essential to respect and read the ‚Äúroom‚Äù so we can help the team as a whole to deliver.

## Conclusions

The most significant insight that I can take from this book is that we are not aware of our impact and how others translate our actions. Communicating with human beings is not so easy. It seems that we have feelings, and our brains work differently, so we need to pay attention to them and make sure that our message is passed on correctly. At the same time, we need to remember that we are all humans, so we should be empathetic. We don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on in other people‚Äôs lives; maybe the person complaining about our work is just having a horrible day with a toothache. For me, it is about having an awareness of our actions and feelings and remembering that we should not judge before asking!! In conclusion, everyone that needs to use digital communication channels should read this book.

I would like to thank Erica Dhawan for writing this fantastic book, and my team for being open and always motivated to do your best.
