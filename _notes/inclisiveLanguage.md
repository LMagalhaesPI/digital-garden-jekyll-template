title: Inclusive language in tech
---

Language is one of the most potent capacities that we have as humans, and it is one of the characteristics that separate us from the rest of the animals. 
The ability to communicate and save information to be used in the future, avoiding wasting time and energy doing the same research repeatedly, boosted human development. Language and breakfast...
It is such a full power tool that it should be used carefully, with the risk of harming someone without even knowing it. 
The goal of inclusive language is not just to avoid hurtful or offensive language but also to make sure that everyone feels welcome, safe, and respected.   
In that order, we should avoid expressions, terms, and actions that be considered sexist, racist, exclusive, or biased in any way against certain groups of people. We cannot forget that "communication is not what you say but how it's heard".

Some tech companies decided to introduce inclusive terminologies, such as Apple, Twitter, GitHub, Chrome, and every day, we have more joining in this movement. 
Here I'm exploring some changes that can be made and why that makes sense:
 
## Master and slave 

It can seem unnecessary because it doesn't make sense. Most of us have never been affected, it is evident that slavery is not a good thing, and we should not do it. But I have to consider the implications of words and phrases experienced by others with a different life stories. We cannot normalize a thing so important as slavery! The goal is to change deeply embedded habits.
Having this into consideration, master and slave should be replaced by primary/replica, primary/standby, primary/secondary, or main branch

## Black and wish

Again, the history of the terms matters, and it was enough to have the "black" work associated with a depreciated meaning. Still, the movement "Black Lives Matter" came to boost this awareness and the vocabulary change in the tech world.  
Considering this whitelist can be translated to allowlist or safelist. Blacklist to denylist, blocklist. QA terms such as white box can be translated to glass box testing or clear box testing, and the black box can be functional testing or acceptance testing.

## Old versos new

Old is bad and new is good!! Who said that? Not always! Legacy can be good! Old can also mean secure, stable, and wise. Ask that to my 101 years old grandfather, the wisest and most trustable person I know!
And even if it is a bad legacy project, I'm sure that software developers did it with the best knowledge and tools they had by the time they did it! 
But of course, we all get better with time! The code that we will do today will need to be refactored sometime in the future.
I can use the old and new worlds, but we should avoid associating them with a negative meaning.
And instead of "grandfathered" term, we can use legacy status or preexisting.

## Equality VS Equity and T-shirts in tech conferences!!!

Equality means each individual or group of people is given the same resources or opportunities. Equity recognizes that each person has different circumstances and allocates the exact resources and opportunities needed to reach an equal outcome. 

I could write a twenty pages article just about women and technology, but for now, I want to explore one of the most uncomplicated issues to solve: T-shirts! 
Why don't we have a woman's size? I don't need more shirts to sleep with, and I don't have a husband to share. Even if I had it, the shirt should be mine, and I should be able to use it :-) 
Usually, at conferences, we have "straight-cut  uni-sex" t-shirts, but uni-sex are made to fit the men and not the women and usually, they are huge! To be honest, I don't care about having huge t-shirts to sleep on, but I care about the assumption that I just have to accept it as a woman. And please don't come up with an excuse that I can share with my husband!! 
Fitted shirts for women will be made with the curves needed to fit the feminine body. We must be comfortable and if that means don't look like a wine barrel, let's work a little bit to prevent it. 
We should also avoid t-shirts with built-in white transparent material, or we can have our Underwear partially exposed. Avoid slogans, text, or images across the chest area that can bring attention to this area.

If a woman wants to wear a men's t-shirt or even no t-shirt, she wons that right to :D

We are all different with different needs, and as part of an inclusive culture, we need to consider this.

## Conclusion
I can bring here many more examples of how we can be inclusive, but for me, the essential rule to respect is the empathy rule. Put yourself in other people's shoes. I never felt discriminated against because of slavery or racism, but I can understand I it can harm someone with a different life story. 
We are all humans, which means that we all have different needs and cannot begin assuming that others have the same behavior as us or will get our message as we intended to. We will fail for sure, and it is ok :-) but we can make sure that we do our best to respect everyone around us.
