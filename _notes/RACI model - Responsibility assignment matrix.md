title: RACI model - Responsibility assignment matrix
---

A RACI matrix is a methodology used in project management where we can define all the stakeholders and how they should be involved in the projects according to the letters R, A, C, and I:

- **Responsible**: a manager or team member who is directly responsible for successfully completing a project task.

- **Accountable**: the person with final authority over the successful completion of the specific task or deliverable. This person delegates and reviews the work involved in a project. He should make sure that the person or team responsible knows the expectations of the project and completes work on time.
  
- **Consulted**: someone with unique insights the team will consult. These people should be consulted before starting the project to gather all the requirements and then during the development to get feedback on what is being done. 
  
- **Informed**: a client or executive who isnâ€™t directly involved, but you should keep up to speed. They could be impacted by the project in any way. We should create an open channel with this group and keep all the information transparent and accurate. 


## Advantages:

Define clear and open communication with the stakeholders, avoiding running in all directions looking for information. 
All the people that can be affected by the project should be updated with the state of it.
