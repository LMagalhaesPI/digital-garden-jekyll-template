title: Ways of working and how to deliver fast keeping quality!!! 
---

As a perfectionist software engineer, the dream would be to have all the products defined for the next few years so I could plan the architecture and technical solutions properly and have time to implement everything following the best architectural principles. Well..it is a utopia and borrowing. 
The truth is that we live in a world where we need to produce experimental work that needs to be released as fast as possible to evaluate the value that it can deliver. 

As humans, we still need to have some routine and a process, so to be resilient, we can define a process in hymen and define our ways of working and using it adapted to our work requests.

- ## Experimental
  The main goal of this WoW is to prove that a feature or project can bring value to the company once we implement it properly, managing resources and timelines. 
  Experimentation is all about building to learn and not building to earn. It should be done inside of an agile environment where we propose several problems and possible solutions that are tested using experimentation and user feedback. It can be an expensive activity, so we should limitate the time and users affected by it to the needed to have enough information to make conscientious decisions. 

  ### What can goes wrong...

  But this is, for me, the most dangerous WoW  for several reasons:

    -  An experiment can turn into a final solution without the proper implementation. When it happens, we will have a system that is not ready to be escalated or provide the best value to the final consumer. In my experience, we can have a microservices with a bunch of ifs in the code and do that same thing in three different ways. It is not complaining about any of the basic rules of keeping a data system:
       -  Maintenance - when we don't have monitoring tools or resources to take problems or recover from them;
       -  Simplicity - keep the system as simple as possible, so ready to be expanded and escalated;
       -  Evolvability - related to complexity and the company's process. We are expecting tasks to evaluate an experiment, but we need to be careful with the scope and requirements changes, or in the end, we will not use our resources wisely. If it is an experiment, we need to have data to help us define our next steps and make decisions based on that data. 
    -  Who will maintain it, and who will manage the data we will get from the experimental? It needs to be taken into consideration from a team's resource perspective.

- ## MVP

MVP or Minimum viable product (not most valuable player as a friend of mine thought it would be!!) is a version of your product with enough features to be used by the client and get feedback. The future of the product depends on it. Working with a feedback loop, we can know in which direction the product should go. We can enter the market quickly and test ideas without spending too many resources (like money).
It is not an experiment. We are building it to earn, but always open to learning and improving in the process. So it should be the first work to be developed after an experiment.  

### What can goes wrong?
 Basically the same thing as in an experimental. In an MVP, we will pay more attention to the technical implementation and get the system ready to be scalable (in this definition of MVP). But it is not the most important thing. 

- ## Final Solution
    Here implement what was planned for the feature to be completed. Of course, we will be working in a feedback loop, and things can change or more things can be added, but at this point, we know from the result of the experiemntal or the MVP what we want to archive with this feature and what our users are expecting from it.
