title: Ways of working and how to deliver fast keeping quality!!! 
---

As a perfectionist software engineer, the dream would be to have all the products defined for the next few years so I could plan the architecture and technical solutions properly and have time to implement everything following the best architectural principles. Well..it is a utopia and borrowing. 
The truth is that we live in a world where we need to produce experimental work that needs to be released as fast as possible to evaluate the value that it can deliver. 

As humans, we still need to have some routine and a process, so to be resilient, we can define a process in hymen and define our ways of working and using it adapted to our work requests.

- ## Experimental
  The main goal of this WoW is to prove that a feature can bring value to the company once we implemented it properly, managing ressources and time lines. But this is for me that moste dangerous WoW  for several reazons:

  ### What can goes wrong...
    -  An experimental can turn into a final solution without the proper implementation. When it happens we will have a system that is not readdy to be escaled or provide the best value to the final consumer. In my experience we can have a microvervice with a bunch of ifs in the code and doing that same thing in three diferent ways. It is not complaining with any of the basic rules to keep a data system:
       -  Maintnace - when we don't have monoting tools or ressouces to tacke problems or recover form it;
       -  Simplicity - keep the system as symple as possible, so ready to be expanded and escalated;
       -  Evolvability - related with complexity and with the companies process. We are expecting tasks to evoluate an experiment, but we need to be careful with the scope and requirements changes or in the end we will not not using our ressources wisely. If it is an experiment we need to have data to help us define our next steps and take decisions basing on that data. 
    -  Who will mantain it and who will manage the data that we will get from the experimental. It needs to be taken into consideration from a teams ressource prespective.

- ## MVP

MVP or Minimum viable product (not most valuable player as a friend of mine thought it would be!!) is a version of your product with enough features to be used by the client and get feedback. The future of the product depends on it. Working with feedback loop we can know in witch direction the product should go. We can entre in the market quicly, test ideas withou spending to much ressources (like money).

### What can goes wrong?
 Basicly the same thing as in a experimental. In an MVP we will pay more attention to the technical implementation, and get the system readdy to be scalable (in this defenition of MVP). But it is not the most important thing 

- ## Final Solution
    Here implement what was planned for the feature to be completed. Of course we will be working in a feedback loop and things can change or more things can be added, but at this point we know from the result of the experiemntal or the MVP what we want to archive with this feature and what our users are expecting from it.
