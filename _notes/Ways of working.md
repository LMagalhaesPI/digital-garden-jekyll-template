title: Ways of working and how to deliver fast keeping quality!!!

As a perfectionist software engineer, the dream would be to have all the products defined for the next few years so I could plan the architecture and technical solutions properly and have time to implement everything following the best architectural principles. Well..it is a utopia and borrowing. 
The truth is that we live in a world where we need to produce experimental work that needs to be released as fast as possible to evaluate the value that it can deliver. 

As humans, we still need to have some routine and a process, so to be resilient, we can define a process in hymen and define our ways of working and using it adapted to our work requests.
