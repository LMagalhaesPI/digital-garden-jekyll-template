title: Technical entreview process! 
---

Points to take into consideration:

- Share the company culture first, or at least write down your core values & principles, it will help you find people who are a good fit for the company;

- be crystal clear about the role and test them with a brief, a challenge or whatever might help you understand how this person would behave in a real work situation and will help them understand better the role they will play, be real about the job: don't hide the boring tasks they will have to take on, they will find out anyway;

-  home assignment that covers somo technical concepts + review the exercise with the candidate 

- We make a career plan and a learning path. More senior devs are repositioned accordingly in the team. What is very important for us is the desire to learn, participate, and self improve. Good attitude. Skills and knowledge can be acquired with courses and time but a good attitude towards challenges is key to make it.
