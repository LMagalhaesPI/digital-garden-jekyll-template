## Kanban metrics or team efficiency

- Burndown Chart - The chart will give us a virtual representation of the number of tasks planned and completed tasks within a particular Kanban board. It can be used to predict future performance and calculate team velocity. But it cannot help us measure our commitment. But does it makes sense? Commit point???
- Lean time -  the period from the moment a task enters the work system to the point it gets completed. So we need to take into consideration all the work done by the product. We greatly value our lean cycle time in the operators duplicated stories. 
- Cycle time - is the time since someone picks the story until it is finished. 
- Cumulative Flow Diagram where we can see it happening. 
- Number of bugs;
- Bottlenecks, number of tasks blocked, and of how long
- We need to respect and implement WIP limit

## Operational Excellence (doesn't make sense for us because we don't have services available in prd, but once we have it)
 - Time to recover;
 - Continuous Integration/ Continuos deployment processes implemented. 
 - Change failure rates
 - Services SLA

## Engineering Excellence
- Code quality 
  - Number of bugs (sonar cloud + gira)
  - Vulnerabilities;
  - Code smells;
  - Code coverage;

## Service maintenance
  - Dashboards 
  - CPU, Memory
