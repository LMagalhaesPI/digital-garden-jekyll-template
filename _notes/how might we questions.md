Problems reformulate as questions "How might we" generate "out of the box" solutions keeping the team focused on the solution and not on the right problem to solve.

## Good HMW questions:

- Start with the problem, you need to know the problem to know the questions;
- Avoid suggestion solutions in the question, the goal is to create the space to inovative solutions. 
- Keep Your HMWs Broad
- Focus on the outcome and not the product, avoid solving symptoms of the problem and not the root cause. 
- Phrase Your HMW Questions Positively
