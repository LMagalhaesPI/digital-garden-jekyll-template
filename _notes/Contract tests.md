### What are contract tests?
Contract tests, or pact tests how is called nowadays, is a technique to test integration between two applications. It can be between two services using HTTP or event sourcing but it also can test integrations between backend and frontend.

### What are the advantages of contract tests?
The major goal of contract tests would be to reduce the number of errors found in the E2E tests bringing it to a previews phase:

It is also useful to detect when a service introduces a breaking change or changes a dependency. 

### How can we implement it?

A contract test is between a consumer and a provider. The consumer can be a Front end application or service and the provider of the application requested. So when doing pact tests using HTTP services or event sourcing the services/applications can assume both roles depending on what we are testing. 
The tests in performed in two phases using a pact broker. The pact broker is the software that will automatcly store and compare the difference contract versions

-> The first phase is preformed by the consumer that will create the contractor;
-> In the second phase this contract is used to check the output and see if contains the expected data generated by the provider;
