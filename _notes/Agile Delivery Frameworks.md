title: Agile Delivery Frameworks
---

Agile it is a framwerk focused in delivering value to the customer, when we talk about agile we are talking about interective deliveri value to customers, the colaboration about business engereering and the customer, the short feedback loop to learn from the customer and improve the services that we build. Team work based on optimise end to end delivery flow empowering people and teams.

-> Satisfy the stake holders/ customer with continuos delivery;
-> Welcome change requirements;
-> regular reflexion how to become more efective.

It is not a methodoly, it is an umbruela under what we can find several methodologies:

## SCRUM

Based on time box iterations, usually 2 weeks long iterations where the team commits to delivery. 
- daily standup meetings
- sprint retrospective in the end of each cyvle
- rapid feedback
- close colaboration with stakeholders abd customers (review) reacting to the customer or project needs;
## KANBAN

Based on lean principles, on the flow base model where we have a board with cards repensenting tasks. The board needs to have at least three production phases: To-Do or backlog, In progress and completed or done All the cards are sequeced prioritized. We will have a work in progress limit. 
We can identifie work to be done, work in progress and work taht is completed according with the board columns.

Kanban principles:

- Start with now: pick the most urgent task and work with what you have;
- Make small incremental changes to improve the process;
- Mantain existing roles;
- Empwer everyone

Kaban keys:

- Visualize workdlow (update the tasks to be visible to all the people)
- Limit the work in progress, jsut move cards in the board if the team has the capacity to deal with;
- Manage the workflow realucating ressources to avoid botle necks
- Craete guidelines for all the stages
- Use feedback loops;
- Improve contuously;
