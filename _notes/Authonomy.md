title: Authonomy as a way to escape the build trap and a motivational toll
---

Reading the book "Escaping the Build Trap: How Effective Product Management Creates Real Value" I was faced up to one more time with the importance of having a shared and transparent company direction and autonomous teams. 

Everyone in the company must be aware of the company's goals and how to measure success. Instead of having the management asking for information without context and the team performing work in the same register, we should be all not in the same boat but in the same direction and be able to find different paths that we will reach the same point. 

In product-led companies, we have to deal with three gaps:

- Knowledge gap: The difference between what we would like to know and what we know; 
- Alignment gap: The difference between what we want people to do and what they do;
- Effects gap: The difference between what we expected from our actions to achieve and what they actually achieved. 

## The importance of having autonomous teams

To have autonomous teams, we need to have all teams aligned with clear directions and goals and be open to making decisions. Autonomy is what able companies to grow. Having all the decisions on top management costs a lot of resources, bureaucracy, delays, Frustrations on the teams, and unhappy people. And usually unhappy people don't produce the best work.

We work with brilliant people, and companies pay a lot of money so they can use the best their brains can. Why not use all these people can offer to give them empowerment and non-judgemental safe space to make decisions?
