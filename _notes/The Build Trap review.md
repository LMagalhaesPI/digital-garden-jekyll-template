## Where are you now?

The book can give you some strategies to validate how mature your product, company team, and strategy are. There are some questions that we can use to validate if we are all in the same page:

- What is the most important thing we could do as a company?
- How do you prioritize your work?
- What is the most important thing we can do to reach our vision? Based on where we are now.


If your people are aligned, you should have similar answers to these questions. 


## What is the problem with a poorly defined product?

When we don't have a direction, we go in all directions. When you are managing a lot of resources (people, money, time), we need to think wisely about how to spend them. 

The unconstrained team is the most frightened and scared to act in the organization. They feel they cannot decide because they have too many options. Appropriate constrained teams, ones who have a direction, feel safe to make a decision because they can see how their stories are align with the goals and strategy of the organization.

## How to solve it?

The company must provide the vision to empower the teams, and the north starts. Then everyone should work on detecting and solving problems that are on the company's path to reach the vision.
The teams should be out of there, analyzing, testing, and learning and then communicating what they discovered back to their peers and their management tools. 

## How to measure that we are going in the right direction?

Once we have a direction defined, we need to have the tool to measure if we are going in the right direction. We can use two kinds of metrics, product and performance metrics.

### Product metrics:
- Pirata metrics
- Heart metrics

### Performance metrics:
- lean time
- story points

## Process to develop a product.

Once we have a north start defined, we need to identify the problems preventing us from reaching it. To do it, we can use the Kata framework.
The Kata framework aims to find the right problem to solve using experiments and user feedback in eternal cycles of testing....Forever... and ever....
Experimentation is all about building to learn and not building to earn. So we need to invest the minimum effort to learn. And we should limit the exposure. Explain to the users what we are doing and why. Keeping than happy to mitigate the risk of failure.

There are three kinds of experiments:

- **Concierge**: do it manually, and the clients know it. It is easy and fast to implement and good to detect problems. Not scalable, so we need to limit the range of users whom we will implement it. It can be expensive from the human resource side. We need to learn what makes sense in the solution and then think about how to scale this to a sustainable offering
- **Wizard of Oz**: the process can be manual, but the user doesn't know about it. Companies tend to keep it for too long.
- **Concept testing** - demonstrate and shows concepts to the users, using video, for instance. We should ask the clients how they feel about it and put themself into the scenario or do the ask. The ask requires some action from the client. For instance, subscribe to a newsletter.

## How to prioritize

Cost of delay - This is a way of communicating value and urgency. Deliver the most value for the capacity we have. It combines urgency and value. We need to understand how valuable something is and how urgent it is to define our priorities. Since, as humans, we are not the best at defining the cost of delay is a fremework that will help on it.
The goal is to be strategic instead of reactive. If your company is creating a product as a demand of user requests, it is reactive. In the end, you will have tones of products very specific for each client and impossible to scale. 


## Conclusion

As a person working to improve your company product, keep an open communication channel with your leaders, stakeholders, team, and clients. 
Do not try to hide your progress from your leaders; they will demand more information and crack down on your freedom to explore.
Fight to have feedback from your clients and stakeholders, implement experimentation, and share the positive results with data that proves it. 
Give space and confidence to your team to raise questions, solutions, and problems, and create a space where everyone can feel comfortable failing and learning from it.
