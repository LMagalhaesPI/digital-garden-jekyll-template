How I explained to my mother how scrum works!!

My mother is a very curious woman and she likes to know how everything works. She has been a former all her life, her main income sources are cows to be turned into beef, chestnuts, and honey. Funny fact, I'm vegan!!  So this cow thing is not really my style!!

When she asked me what was this thing: SCRUM!!! I had to create an analogy with what she does in her day-to-day life:

Mom, just pretend you have to move your cows from one place to other, and you have a final date to have the cows in the final destination. You have a map, but unexpected things can happen and you can't trust the map!
If you are using waterfall as methodology you will verify just at the end of your trip that you are on the good path!!

But if you are using scrum every sprint, that can be one day or two weeks, you will validate that you are in a good direction. So if you are going in the wrong direction you still have time to take the right path, or maybe improve your trip and take a shortcut!!

For me, the biggest advantage we have working in a scrum agile environment is the opportunity to validate with our final clients and stakeholders our work every two weeks. If we are following the wrong path or if we miss something it will be noticed in an up-flow fase instead of being working over something that is not the expected final product.
