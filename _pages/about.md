## A little bit more about me:

    <td style="width:50%; padding-left: 20pt; vertical-align: top;">My name is Luísa Magalhães, and I'm a software engineer among other things.👩‍💻
I grew up in a little village in the north of Portugal. A typical small village where everyone knows each other and half of the population is my family!! 😨

My mother is a farmer so I grew up in the countryside, with a lot of animals and books that I insisted to always bring with me. This created in me the values of `community` and `respect` for others and everything around us ( I'm almost vegan and it's killing my mother!).
<br/>

Small communities can be difficult to manage especially if you like to raise questions that break the status quo.

I understood early in my life that I really enjoy learning and discovering new things. This brought me to my technical path. I got a Degree in Computer Science and since then I've been working in several companies as a software developer. I have experience with Farfetch, Localsofware Techbiosis, and DefinedCrowd.
As a software developer, I love to dive into new technologies and challenges. What gives me the most pleasure in my profession is the possibility to create, plan and develop new products. Always focused on `quality`, `innovation`, and the `value` that I'm delivering.
The fact that I grew up in a rural world and succeeded in the technology field is proof of my `resilience`, `perseverance`, and capacity of taking new `challenges`. 💪💪💪

`Inclusiveness` is also a fight for me not just because of the limitations that society tends to force us to assume regarding our sexual and relational decisions but also because I have a chronic disease that can impact my physical way of how to be in the future. What could be seen by some people as a concern I think is a help to prioritize where I can spend my time and energy.

I'm a good `communicator` and in the last year (2020 - not the best one, I know!) I've decided to dedicate more time to this side of my personality. I had the opportunity to become a tech lead in DefinedCrowd. This showed me that I'm the type of person that “gets stuff done”. And I always make sure the team is motivated and on the same page.

As a tech lead my roles are the management of features with the product team and the management of the team. I
realized that it is extremely comforting to work on the progress of those who are with us, motivating their growth and providing the necessary tools to make it happen.😍
