# Welcome! 🌱

Hello 🤗👋
My name is Luísa Magalhães.  I'm a software developer and tech lead, passionate about technology, self-improvement, and humanity (most of my days!! 😳).
This is my small digital garden where I drop notes and articles about any subject that I'm diving in. 
You can find here my reflections and experiences about several technologies, management. And a place where everyone is invited to interact with an open mind and give feedback!!! 
Fell free to send me a message on my [Twitter (@LusaMagalhes11)](https://twitter.com/LusaMagalhes11)

You will not find here any kind of criticism, judgment, or vegan recipes (but I'm really good at the last one🧆🧆).
